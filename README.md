Hello!

This is Rolodope, or well my 2 week prototype of it anyway. 

It is heavily based on Patatap, which is a really awesome interactive keyboard + visualizer. 

Similarly, Rolodope is a interactive keyboard with a tied visualizer, but the difference is functionality is mainly that Rolodope offers an interface for users adjusting the notes and sounds for the user to edit what keys are bound to what.

My files are in the src folder, the rest are a basic vite project provided by my instructor for IGME-330 (Rich Media Web App Dev).

TODO Features are/were:
- Expanding the Animation System
- Improving and increasing the inbuilt animation set
- Ability to upload canvas animations and audio
- Improve the UI
